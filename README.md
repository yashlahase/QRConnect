## 3. Problem Statement
Traditional paper visiting cards are often lost, forgotten, or damaged. They are also not eco-friendly and cannot be updated once printed.  
In today’s digital era, there is a need for a simple, eco-friendly, and instant way to share personal or professional contact details without relying on physical cards.

QRConnect is a mobile app that allows users to create a **digital visiting card** by filling in their details such as name, phone number, email, LinkedIn, Instagram, and personal website.  
The app generates a **unique QR code** for each user, which can be scanned by others (who also have the app installed) to instantly view and save their contact details.
